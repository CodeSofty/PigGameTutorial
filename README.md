HOW TO PLAY: 

BASE GAME RULES -

The game is a simple dice rolling game. The goal is to reach 100 points in the global score box (the large numbers).

The player will 'roll' the dice, and can either store ('hold') the current value into the global score box, or take a chance and roll again.

If the active player rolls a 1, then the game removes the unheld points and switches to the next player and they can then roll. The next player can then play.

The first one to reach 100 points wins the game!

THE CHALLENGES FILES RULES - 

These files contain changes to the base game rules. The players can change the goal from the original 100 to a custom amount using the input field. It can even be changed within the same game, so it's flexible during play sessions.

The gameboard uses two dice and will still take away the unheld points and switches players. The game will also check to see if there were 2 consecutive 6's rolled, and also take away the unheld points and switch players.


TO PLAY -
